to avoid the commercials we offer you an ad-free version of our
software for a tiny annual fee. In addition to that, you can buy
additional functions that will extend the functionality of the
software and facilitate its handling (“in-app-purchasing”). These
optional in-app-purchases will be available on our website

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><SPAN LANG="en-US">1.
We shall be liable for all damages incurred by you due to grossly
negligent or intentional behavior on our part or by a culpable injury
to life, body or health or for which we have assumed a guarantee or
warranty and for which we are liable under the Product Liability Act
of Germany. In all other cases our liability for damages is limited
to the breach of essential contractual obligations. Such essential
contractual obligations are only those obligations which enable the
proper execution of this agreement and on whose fulfillment you may
trust. In cases of negligent breach of essential contractual
obligations by us, our liability is limited to the foreseeable,
contractually typical damages. A strict liability for shortcomings
already existent at the time of conclusion of this license agreement
is expressly excluded. The above limitations shall apply with respect
to all representatives of us, especially with respect to our
directors, legal representatives, employees and other agents. To the
extent as permitted by law, our liability is limited to a total
amount which corresponds to the maximum of ten times the applicable
license fee actually paid by you.</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><SPAN LANG="en-US">2.
We are not responsible for the content that you or other licensees
using the software record, reproduce, make available to third parties
and / or transmit. If such content should infringe third party rights
and cause these third parties to subrogate against us, you agree to
fully and immediately indemnify us, in case the disputed contents
were sent via your account, upon first demand from all claims of said
third parties. If a licensee is reported to us, because his behavior
or the content transmitted by him violate the law or interfere with
the rights of others inappropriately, we shall be entitled to
terminate or delete the account at our sole discretion. A
compensation of any kind is excluded in such cases. We will act only
when confronted with flagrant violations of the law; there is no
legal entitlement to an action on our part before a judicial finding
of an unlawful conduct of a licensee.</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><SPAN LANG="en-US">3.
We only provide a communication platform for registered licensees;
the data and information transmitted between the licensees will not
be monitored by us, checked and/or censored because they are
exchanged within a closed group of people and are secured by data
privacy and other laws. For this reason, in case you receive content
that affects you in your rights, you waive your right to claim
damages from us based on such interference with your rights.</SPAN></P>
